## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The purpose of this project was to using low level programming to simulate a control system for a thermostat. It was teaching how to program for multiple IO types like buttons and terminal inputs to control LED's on a micro-board.
## What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a good job with creating readable code that functioned well. I know for some milestones I was not able to get my work to be 100% accurate but I did a good job in getting very close.
## Where could you improve?
My main issue was with debugging. I found it very challenging to use breakpoints in the beginning and could have made more use of stepping through my code. It was difficult for me to pinpoint exactly why my morse code script was not functioning as intened.
## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I used google, particulary stack overflow a lot when it came to problem solving. I had a huge issue with teh UART header file not being present and first. It was very challening to fix and I ended up finding the solution deep in an old forum page. I had to download an
outdated version of an SDK in order to get the file I needed.
## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I will use my new debugging skills on all of my future projects. I am already make use of these skills with an injectable menu I am making for a game. Using the debugger and stepping through the code has been a huge help now that I learned it after this course.
## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made my project with a clear plan in mind. This helped me avoid getting sidetracked and writing spaghetti code. In the end I was able to have a clean script that completed the requirements and was easy to read and updates
